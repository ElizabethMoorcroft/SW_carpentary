Tigers and other large cats
===============
Tigers live in Asia. They are the largest naturally occurring in the world. 
They are hyper carnivores being that they have to eat a larger proportion of meat then regular carviores.

To estimate the number of tigers in the wild the most common monitoring method is camera trapping.
